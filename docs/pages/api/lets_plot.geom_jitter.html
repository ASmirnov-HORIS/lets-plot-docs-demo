<p class="rubric">Notes</p>
<p>The jitter geometry is used to create jittered points.
The scatterplot is useful for displaying the relationship between two discrete variables.</p>
<p><cite>geom_jitter()</cite> understands the following aesthetics mappings:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>x : x-axis value.</p></li>
<li><p>y : y-axis value.</p></li>
<li><p>alpha : transparency level of a point. Accept values between 0 and 1.</p></li>
<li><p>color (colour) : color of the geometry. String in the following formats: RGB/RGBA (e.g. “rgb(0, 0, 255)”); HEX (e.g. “#0000FF”); color name (e.g. “red”); role name (“pen”, “paper” or “brush”).</p></li>
<li><p>fill : fill color. Is applied only to the points of shapes having inner area. String in the following formats: RGB/RGBA (e.g. “rgb(0, 0, 255)”); HEX (e.g. “#0000FF”); color name (e.g. “red”); role name (“pen”, “paper” or “brush”).</p></li>
<li><p>shape : shape of the point, an integer from 0 to 25.</p></li>
<li><p>size : size of the point.</p></li>
<li><p>stroke : width of the shape border. Applied only to the shapes having border.</p></li>
</ul>
